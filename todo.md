### David's requests 

* make a Treemap component 
* fix HeatMap for 
* fix the Sizing!!!!! percentage

### L's bugbears

1)  bubble chart, sunburst: put in div center so doesn't look weird and offset

2)  punch card sizing is being obnoxious, check [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kaezarrex/10122633) for reference on how to fix

3)  pie chart text in center - DLG still wants that as a template we can play with, so we need to export the center coords I think? 

4)  bubble chart - should we add margin to make sure we see the entire bubble? make margin not a @Input()? 

5)  percentage sizing does not work unless the immediate parent element has explicit dimensions

6)  add xAxisAngle to line-plot
