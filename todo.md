### David's requests 

* make a Treemap component 
* bar chart - color per bar
* bar chart - missing numbers (-50)
* line chart - make gradient and colors for the gradient configurable @Inputs 

### L's bugbears

1)  bubble chart, sunburst: put in div center so doesn't look weird and offset

2)  punch card sizing is being obnoxious, check [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kaezarrex/10122633) for reference on how to fix

3)  pie chart text in center - DLG still wants that as a template we can play with, so we need to export the center coords I think? 

4)  bubble chart - should we add margin to make sure we see the entire bubble? make margin not a @Input()?
