1)  bubble chart, sunburst: put in div center so doesn't look weird and offset
2)  punch card sizing is being obnoxious, check [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kaezarrex/10122633) for reference on how to fix
3)  pie chart text in center - DLG still wants that as a template we can play with, so we need to export the center coords I think? 
4)  bubble chart - should we add margin to make sure we see the entire bubble? make margin not a @Input()? 
5)  make a Treemap component
